[Pork Roast](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-kalua-pork-sandwiches/43f26dcf-239c-4c4a-8433-128eb99b42dc)

### Ingredients 
- 2 pork roasts (butt) trimmed ~4lbs
- 2 tablespoons of coarse sea salt
- 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke

### Instructions
- Trim fat
- Make 1-inch slits/groves all around roast 
- Rub in salt into each roast, cover entire roast
- Place into slow cooker
- Cover roast with liquid smoke
- Cook 14 hours (overnight)
- Shred with fork

#### Optional
- Strain drippings 
- Return pulled pork and dripping to warmed crock-pot until moist

### Reaction
Woke up to browned (some caramelized) and juicy pork roast. I mean this looked like Thanksgiving or Christmas morning in a crock-pot. =D 

#### @TODO
- What to do with drippings, gravy? 

## Why?
I really should just create a cooking blog, but all I really want is a place to keep some cooking notes so the next I make a recipe, 3-6 months later I have not completely forgotten what I have learned. 

Maybe break out each recipe into a separate file. 
Maybe just make your own simple blog, incorporate markdown, and make it easy to use.
